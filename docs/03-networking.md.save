# Phase 3: Networking & DNS / External Access

## Objective
Make the EC2 server externally accessible securely using an Elastic IP, while controlling network access.

## Step 1: Review Security Groups
- Checked inbound rules to allow only essential ports:
  - SSH (22) → admin access
  - HTTP (80) → web access
  - HTTPS (443) → optional for SSL later
- Ensured no unnecessary ports were open.

## Step 2: Allocate Elastic IP
- Allocated an Elastic IP via AWS console:
  - Example: 34.226.79.215
- **Purpose:** Prevent IP changes after EC2 restart and simplify external access.

## Step 3: Associate Elastic IP to EC2
- Associated Elastic IP to the EC2 instance to make it reachable.
- Verified Elastic IP attachment via EC2 console.
- Note: DNS mapping using temporary services (nip.io) was considered but skipped due to network limitations.

## Step 4a: Verify External Access
- Tested Nginx locally on EC2:
 
  curl http://localhost

- Expected output: Nginx default welcome page.
## Step 4b: Tested Nginx externally using Elastic IP:
curl http://34.226.79.215
## Step 4c: Test Nginx via browser (external access)

4d. Security Group Verification

Ensure only necessary ports are open for access:

Type	Port	Source
SSH	22	Your IP / 0.0.0.0/0
HTTP	80	0.0.0.0/0
HTTPS	443	0.0.0.0/0 (optional)

Purpose: Restricts access to only essential services, following security best practices.
